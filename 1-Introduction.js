Introduction to JavaScript
---------------------------

* JavaScript runs inside environment

* We install Browser or  Node Js (environment) and js runs inside them

* Different browser use Different Js Engine
  - Js provide logic inside different engines
  - All the features will be provided by browsers or node js

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

* JavaScript -> built in 10 days (broken as well as perfect)
             -> Took syntax of java 
             -> In Self (oops) -> where objects are created from object
             -> Functional programming -> Functions can work as variable

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------    

* JavaScript was the copyright of Java by Oracle
            -> Started an organisation (Ecma International)
            -> It writes the standard -> this should beahve in such a way
            -> JavaScript is nothing but EcmaScript -> ES
            -> ES-1 , ES-2 , ES-3, ES-5 , ES-6
            -> JavaScript is written by vendors of browser (TC-39) and they
               define what feature should be included in js.
            -> All browser implement according to their own language
               chrome -> V8 Engine

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Node js -> Run Time Enviorment
  Vanilla Js -> Simple Javascript
  React, Angular, Veu Js -> Front library / Framework ->  used to reduce UI cost
